    <h3>This fluffy French toast recipe is crisp on the outside, but perfectly soft and tender on the inside.</h3>
    <p>The secret ingredient in this fluffy French toast recipe: all-purpose flour! Flour binds the liquids together,
        which creates a more traditional “batter” and helps prevent soggy results. This extra ingredient ensures the
        French toast is crispy on the outside, but soft and fluffy on the inside.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Flour: This fluffy French toast batter starts with ¼ cup all-purpose flour. </li>
        <li>Milk: Milk adds moisture and richness to the batter. You can substitute half-and-half, cream, or your
            favorite alternative milk if you like. </li>
        <li>Eggs: Of course, you’ll need eggs for French toast! Three eggs bind the batter together and give it a rich
            texture. </li>
        <li>Sugar: A tablespoon of white sugar lends welcome sweetness to this decadent breakfast recipe.</li>
        <li>Vanilla: A teaspoon of vanilla extract adds complexity and takes the flavor up a notch.</li>
        <li>Cinnamon: Ground cinnamon lends coziness and warmth.</li>
        <li>Salt: A pinch of salt enhances the flavors of the other ingredients, but it won’t make your French toast
            taste salty.</li>
        <li>Bread: You’ll need 12 slices of your favorite thick-sliced bread. Good choices include brioche, sourdough,
            French bread, or challah.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Slowly whisk the milk into the flour, then whisk in the remaining ingredients.</li>
        <li>Saturate the bread slices in the batter.</li>
        <li>Cook the French toast on a lightly oiled griddle or pan until golden on both sides.</li>
    </ol>
