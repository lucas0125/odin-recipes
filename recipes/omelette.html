        <h3>The Denver Omelette</h3>
        <p>The Denver omelet is a change of pace from a French omelet and is known for its firmer texture and
            caramelized flavor. It's one of the first foods I learned to cook professionally as a line cook in high
            school. Make it a complete lunch or dinner with arugula salad and toasted bread.</p>

            <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>3 large eggs</li>
                <li>1/4 cup diced smoked ham</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons diced onion</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons diced green bell pepper</li>
                <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
                <li>1/3 cup shredded Cheddar cheese</li>
                <li>1 pinch cayenne pepper</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li> Gather all ingredients. </li>
                <li> Beat eggs in a small bowl until just combined; do not overbeat. </li>
                <li> Melt butter in a skillet over medium-high heat. Add ham, onion, and bell pepper; season with salt
                    and pepper. Cook and stir until onions soften and ham begins to caramelize, about 5 minutes. </li>
                <li> Reduce heat to medium-low and pour in eggs. Mix briefly with a spatula while shaking the pan to
                    ensure ingredients are evenly distributed. </li>
                <li> Quickly run the spatula along edges of omelet. </li>
                <li> Sprinkle Cheddar cheese and cayenne pepper over omelet. </li>
                <li> Cook, shaking the pan occasionally, until top is still wet but not runny, about 5 minutes. Use a
                    spatula to fold omelet in half and transfer it to a plate. </li>
            </ol>
